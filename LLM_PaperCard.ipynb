    "\n",
    "Problem: Simply finetuning LLMs with naively sampled long corpora does not ensure improved long-context modeling capabilities.\n",

    "Motivation: High-quality long-text data is characterized by the presence of long-range dependencies.\n",

    "1. Divide a sample into several equal portions.\n",
